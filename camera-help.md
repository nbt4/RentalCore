# 📹 Camera Fix Instructions

## 🚨 **THE PROBLEM**
Modern browsers require **HTTPS** or **localhost** for camera access. 

You're accessing via: `http://10.0.0.100:8080` ❌
This won't work for camera!

## ✅ **SOLUTIONS**

### Option 1: Use localhost (EASIEST)
```bash
# Access the app via:
http://localhost:9000/scan/1002
```

### Option 2: Use HTTPS
Set up SSL/TLS certificate for production

### Option 3: Use Manual Input (WORKS NOW)
The manual input section now has clear instructions and examples!

## 🔧 **What I Fixed**
- ✅ Better error detection
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Prominent manual input fallback
- ✅ Helpful instructions in UI
- ✅ Example device IDs shown

## 📱 **Manual Input Works Perfectly**
You can scan devices by typing:
- SUB1001, SUB1002, etc. (Subwoofers)
- TOP1001, TOP1002, etc. (Satellites) 
- MIC1001, MIC1002, etc. (Microphones)
- Any device ID from your database

The manual input is just as fast as camera scanning!
