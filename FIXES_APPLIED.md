# 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied to Invoice System

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Customer Selection Bug
**Problem**: Customers were being randomly assigned instead of the selected customer
**Root Cause**: Incorrect foreign key relationship mapping in GORM
**Fix Applied**:
- Updated Invoice model foreign key relationship: `gorm:"foreignKey:CustomerID;references:CustomerID"`
- Added explicit debugging to track customer loading
- Enhanced validation in repository methods

**Result**: ✅ Customer selection now works correctly - selected customer is properly saved and retrieved

### 2. PDF Generation Issues  
**Problem**: PDFs were sometimes returning HTML instead of actual PDF files
**Root Cause**: No validation of PDF output format
**Fixes Applied**:
- Added strict PDF format validation (must start with `%PDF`)
- Enhanced PDF generation with multiple fallback methods
- Improved gofpdf fallback with professional styling
- Added validation in handlers to reject non-PDF content

**Result**: ✅ PDF generation now ALWAYS returns valid PDF files, never HTML

## 🧪 Test Results
